        <p>
            Our hens live in cage-free barns with ample daily access to the outdoors. Although our standards in many ways mimic those set forth by various entities that provide certification for engaging in ethical and humane practices, we have deliberately chosen not to seek such certifications or make overt claims about the ethical nature of our standards. As farmers overseeing the care of our hens, we are whole-heartedly committed to doing what we believe is best for our flocks. The fact that each of our flocks are cage-free and free-range demonstrates our commitment to being good stewards. In addition, we are transparent with our standards, which allows our consumers to determine if these standards are sufficient. In addition, certifications are often costly, and these costs are ultimately passed on to the consumer. We believe such costs are unnecessary as long as we are clearly communicating our standards to those buying our eggs. In sum, we believe in and are committed to our production standards, and we trust consumers to determine if our standards meet their expectations for ethical and humane practices.          </p>
